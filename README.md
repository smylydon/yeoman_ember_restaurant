yeoman_ember_restuarant
=======================
The frontend javascript code was from an ember tutorial I took. Like most ember tutorials it used the fixtures adapter and localstorage instead of a real backend server. So I decided to learn how to hook up an ember project to a backend server - the hardway by doing it. I setup a REST server using node, express and mongodb, I used robomongo as my database admin tool.
